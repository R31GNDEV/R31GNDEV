👋 Hii, my name is Dakota, you can call me "Kota". I'm a learning (very novice) software engineer who would someday like to specialize in reverse engineering. I am very passionate about modern *mobile and web technology* while taking into consideration the latest trends and techniques. I host the Twitter bot @iloveveryword<br/>

## 💼 Career: 
- I am unemployed. I used to be an Assembly worker for Hennig in January but had lost my postion due to covid. I've never had an occupation related to web development. Although, I am highly interested. Still actively looking for work while I work odd jobs.

## 💻 Tech Experiences:
- Jailbreak multiple devices such as a Nintendo Switch, most Apple devices, PS3, and Xbox 360.
- Built multiple websites with HTML & CSS
- Built an iOS Jailbreak Repo
- Had a Discord server with 400+ users related to a DayZ video game server I used to host through OVH.
- Configure AWS EC2 Environments for multiple types of bots
- Adobe Photoshop & After Effects
- iOS App/Theme Development

## 🔍 Currently Learning:
- Objective C/Swift (iOS Tweak development via Theos)
***And, I would be open-mind to learning other Tech Stacks if needed.***
